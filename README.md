# php-yaml-router
A YAML based PHP routing boilerplate

The project is meant as a simple boilerplate for creating a PHP API.

It allows you to simply create endpoints by defining them in <b>config/routing.yml</b> and specifying a class and method, which will be fired upon calling the request. The Yaml configuration allows you to inject dependencies to your classes dynamicly.
